Creating and Selling Items: If you have a creative flair, you can create and sell items on the Roblox marketplace, earning Robux in the process. 

## Protecting Yourself from Scams:

Be Skeptical of "Too Good to Be True" Offers: If a website promises free Roblox gift card codes without any effort on your part, it's likely a scam.
